# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built using Java Swing for GUI and Socket programming for networking. 
The application allows communication between a server and multiple clients over a local network.

## Features

- **Server**: Allows one client to connect at a time. Messages sent by clients are displayed on the server's GUI.
- **Client**: Connects to the server and sends messages. Messages received from the server are displayed on the client's GUI.
- **GUI**: Uses Java Swing for a simple and intuitive graphical interface.
- **Messaging**: Messages are displayed in formatted panels with timestamps.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) for running the project
- Basic knowledge of Java and GUI programming with Swing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans).

3. Compile and run the Server.java file to start the server.

4. Compile and run the Client.java file to start the client. You can run multiple instances for testing.

## Usage
1. Start the Server first. It will listen for incoming connections on port 6001.

2. Start the Client application and enter the server's IP address (usually 127.0.0.1 if running locally) and port 6001.

3. Once connected, type messages in the client's text field and press Send to send messages to the server.

4. Messages received from other clients connected to the same server will appear in the client's GUI.

5. To exit the application, simply close the window or terminate the program.
